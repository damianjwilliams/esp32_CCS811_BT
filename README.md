# esp32_CCS811_BT
Environmental data from a CCS811 using Bluetooth, displayed on a Python GUI


Arduino and python code for streaming CCS811 sensor data over Bluetooth. The measurements are displayed on a Python tkinter GUI. The arduino BluetoothSerial ESP32 library, provides an emulated Serial connection which operates using Bluetooth classic. The arduino code is based on the ESP32 SerialtoSerial example in the ESP32 core and the [SparkFun CCS811 Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_CCS811_Arduino_Library). A BME280 is integrated to enable temperature compensation of the CCS811 readings. Much of the python code for the GUI is from an [adafruit tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-temperature-and-humidity-sensor/python-interface). 


## Requirements
- ESP32 -  I used the HUZZAH32 â€“ ESP32 Feather Board from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405)

- BME280 - Sparkfun Atmospheric Sensor Breakout - BME280 from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13676)

- CCS811 - Air Quality Breakout from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14193)

- Python 3.6+


## Usage

An overview of the process can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7pM1rQDjBs). The instructions are for Windows 10, but easily adapted for OSX, etc.

Upload ESP32 code and libraries described in the links above.

Once the code is uploaded, "The device started, now you can pair it with bluetooth!" is shown on the arduino serial monitor and environmental data begins to appear. 

The "ESP32_enviroment_sensor" should be visible in Bluetooth Devices:

On your PC, select Start  > Settings  > Devices  > Bluetooth & other devices  > Add Bluetooth or other device > Bluetooth. Choose the "ESP32_enviroment_sensor" and pair.

Determine which COM port is being used: Start  > Settings  > Devices  > Bluetooth & other devices > More Bluetooth Options (under Related Settings) > Bluetooth Settings Window > COM port tab. The correct port is labelled as Outgoing under the Direction column. You can also identify the port through the Device Manager.

Enter the correct serial port on line 10 of the python script. Run the script.
